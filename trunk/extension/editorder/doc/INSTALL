Innoteam editorder extension v. 1.0 INSTALL

Caveat
======
This extension was developed and tested on eZPublish 4.3. There is no guarantee it works on older version.
Since it messes with the database, be careful.

Installing editorder extension
==============================================

1. Put the package content into the `extension' directory in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. You must now enable the extension in eZ publish. To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the 
   folder root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add)
   the block [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=editorder

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the sites should use
   the extension, make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=editorder
   
3. Set the permission for module editorder and function edit for the user(s) and/or the users group(s) you 
   want allow to use it. 
   
Options
=======
1. To let maintenance be easier, editorder override the orderlist.tpl, with an identical version that 
   finds out the groups the user currently logged in belongs searching the settings/content.ini.append.php 
   for a specific object ID under the UserGroups setting:
   
   {let $receptionistsID = ezini('UserGroups', 'ReceptionistsObjectID', 'content.ini.append.php')}
   
   and use it to activate a tiny control in order to decide to link the orders to the default view (orderview.tpl) 
   or to the edit view (edit.tpl). 
   
   {if $current_user.groups|contains($receptionistsID)}
   		{concat("/editorder/edit/", $Orders.item.id,"/")|ezurl}
   {else}
		{concat( '/shop/orderview/', $Orders.item.id, '/' )|ezurl}
   {/if}
    			
   If you want to avoid this, simply delete the control and the previous call and let anybody access the page 
   called by /editorder/edit/orderID.
   
   In a similar way, if you want to let more groups or more users access the page, add multiple UserGroups and/or
   Users and edit the control accordingly.

2. The extension was requested having a particular list of nations, that are stored into settings/country.ini and 
   are used by the template /templates/shop/country/edit.tpl to list the countries. 
   If you want to use the default template, simply delete the folder. The eZPublish fallback templates system will 
   take care of showing the default list.
